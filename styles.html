        <h1>How Do You Take Care of Eyelash Extensions?</h1>
        <h2>Avoid Water, Sweat, and Hot Showers Within the First 48 Hours</h2>
        <p>Avoiding water, sweat, and hot showers helps the glue to set perfectly around the extensions. Doing so will make your lashes last longer. </p>
        <p>You can wash the rest of your face but avoid water coming into contact with the eye area.</p>
        <h2>Avoid Rubbing Your Eyes</h2>
        <p>This rule applies during the first 48 hours when the glue has not yet set. Rubbing your eyes could also transfer germs to lashes, leading to infections of your eyes.</p>
        <p>After 48 hours, it is safe to touch or rub your eyes. However, as long as you have the eyelash extensions on, you should avoid rubbing your eyes as much as possible to help keep the extensions in place.</p>
        <h2>Avoid Eye Makeup</h2>
        <p>Using eye makeup in the first 48 hours after application is not advised. </p>
        <h2>Using a Spoolie Brush</h2>
        <p>A lash brush or spoolie is a small comb that you use to brush your lashes. You will use it especially in the morning since this is the time when the lashes could be tangled.</p>
        <h2>Protect Your Lashes in The Shower</h2>
        <p>Eyelash extensions should not disrupt your shower routine, especially after the first 48 hours. </p>
